![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3.8.3-orange)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

***In this repository, fundamental basics of data structures and algorithms is covered. To be clear, it is NOT done in depth as these fundamentals are for revision purpose for anyone who is pursing Data Science/Machine learning/Deep Learning specialization***

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Note** - These learning are done from LinkedIn Learning courses. However the notes are made through **self-understanding** and **programs** uploaded are written myself with own comments and inferences. The original solutions are not shared here.

There will 2 things contributed here:
* Notes (will be uploaded in the end)
* Programs (Using Python on Microsoft Visual Studio Code)

These are the following topics covered:
